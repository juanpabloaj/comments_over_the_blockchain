# Comments over the blockchain
Make comments over the blockchain

[live demo](http://juanpabloaj.com/comments_over_the_blockchain/)

This javascript snippet is a simple way to add to any content or project a comment system, a comment system over the blockchain.

A online content or project only need publish his transaction address and add the snippet. Every new transaction with a message is a new comment to show.

If you like some project or content, you can make a transaction with a message to support this with your opinion and with some bitcoins.

Proof of concept, just for fun.
